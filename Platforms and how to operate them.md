Platform:

Python 3(x) with the numpy library (core)

Can be developed to run on:

Conventional computers because the simulation part is simplified.

Cloud environments with high computing resources.

Quantum research labs if connected to real quantum devices.

To run:

The Python environment must be set up with the required libraries (numpy, logging).

Import the packages and create an object from QuantumConsciousnessCore.

Call the process_input function with appropriate numerical data (such as floating-point vector numbers).

Example for initial execution:

python:


from veronica.core.consciousness import QuantumConsciousnessCore
import numpy as np

qc = QuantumConsciousnessCore(n_qubits=8)
input_vector = np.random.random(8)
output = qc.process_input(input_vector)
print(output)



For VeronicaXProEnhanced, HybridMemorySystem, and others, the associated source files must exist and the system must be run as a library or as an integrated system.
